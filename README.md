Lyrics :
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive (It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
You've got to make your owns breaks

It's my life
And It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live when I'm alive (It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend don't break, baby don't back down

It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live when I'm alive (It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live when I'm alive (It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life!
